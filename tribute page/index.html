            <ul class="py-4">
               <p>Lata Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929 in a Gomantak Maratha Samaj family[16][17] in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India). She was the eldest daughter of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi classical singer and theatre actor and his wife Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati[18] woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra). Shevanti was Deenanath's second wife - his first wife Narmada, who had died before his marriage to Shevanti, was Shevanti's older sister.Her educational career is not much known but she proved that a degree is not the only way to earn. She received her first music lesson from her father. When she was five years old, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays.  </p>

                <ul class="py-4">
                   <p>Lata Mangeshkar's vocals had a massive cultural imprint in the global music industry. Her voice has been sampled in multiple tracks across genres in the international music scene. Her voice has been used almost like an instrument, adding a pleasant sense of fusion to the tracks.
                    In 2002, when the Internet and music TV shows were beginning to reach a wider populace in India, R&B singer Shari Watson aka Truth Hurts and hip-hop heavyweight Rakim tag-teamed on "Addictive," which opened with an unmistakable croon – one of Lata Mangeshkar. The American song, which sampled the late legendary voice on "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" (from 1981 movie Jyoti) landed into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts and had Dr. Dre as executive producer. But even as we enjoyed a cross cultural take on Mangeshkar's inimitable vocals, composer Bappi Lahiri and record label Saregama India were none too impressed. The singer sought to stop sales of the single and Truth Hurts' album Truthfully Speaking, while Saregama took the team behind "Addictive" to court, seeking $500 million in damages.
